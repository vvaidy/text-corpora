### **France Inter - The Orwellian Moment? Attacks on Science Under the Trump Administration**

#### **Introduction**
**00:01 (Speaker A)**  
France Inter. Léa Salamé, Nicolas Demorand. The 7-10 morning show.  

**00:06 (Speaker B)**  
And this morning, we are holding a roundtable discussion on the unprecedented attacks against science and researchers by the new Trump administration. We’ll discuss this, Léa, with three prominent scientific voices.  

**00:20 (Speaker A)**  
Valérie Masson-Delmotte, good morning. You are a climatologist, you co-chaired the IPCC for eight years until 2023, and you are a leading expert on climate issues. Our listeners know you well. You are also a pediatrician and an immunology specialist… Most importantly, you were the president of the Advisory Council on Vaccination Strategy during the COVID crisis.  

**00:21 (Speaker A)**  
And Olivier Bernet, you are an astrophysicist, a researcher at IFR-IRAP, and one of the initiators of the *Stand up for Science* movement in France.  

**00:52 (Speaker A)**  
This movement, which we will discuss.  

**00:53 (Speaker B)**  
And the reason we have brought you together today is that all three of you have signed an op-ed published in *Le Monde*, which begins with these words:  
*"Universities and research institutions are today the target of unprecedented attacks in the United States, threatening one of the pillars of democracy—academic and scientific freedom."*  
The op-ed, titled *"Defend Science Against the New Obscurantism"*, warns of the Trump administration’s attacks on science and calls for a worldwide day of mobilization this Friday, March 7.

#### **Fear in the American Scientific Community**
**01:34 (Speaker B)**  
Can you explain to us, in simple terms and with specific examples, what has been happening in the U.S. research community over the past six weeks? Olivier Bernet?  

**01:47 (Speaker C)**  
I have worked with my colleagues in the U.S. for 20 years, and since Donald Trump’s inauguration, I have been hearing things I never imagined I’d hear. The level of fear is unprecedented.  

**02:02 (Speaker A)**  
What exactly are they telling you?  

**02:03 (Speaker C)**  
They say they’re scared—literally, "We are afraid." They barely dare to speak.  

**02:08 (Speaker A)**  
You have colleagues at NASA, right?  

**02:10 (Speaker C)**  
Yes, and they’re terrified. They’re afraid of losing their jobs, of their data being erased, of their research being wiped out. Some fear losing their visas and being deported. Just yesterday, Trump declared that if protests took place on campuses, participants could be imprisoned or deported. Their fears are completely justified.  

**02:38 (Speaker C)**  
The situation is dire.

#### **The Censorship of Science**
**03:12 (Speaker D)**  
Yes, and you mentioned earlier that J. Devance, the Vice President, declared in 2021 that *"universities are the enemy, professors are the enemy."* Science has now become a target. On U.S. government websites—whether it's the Department of Defense, Agriculture, Energy, or the Environmental Protection Agency—all references to climate change have been erased.  

**03:33 (Speaker D)**  
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which plays a crucial global role in ocean and climate monitoring, has been gutted. Entire scientific teams have been fired. The funding body for American research, the NSF, has been thrown into chaos, which, for instance, is disrupting Antarctic research.  

**05:31 (Speaker D)**  
The team supporting my colleague, Kate Calvin, a chief scientist at NASA, was abruptly dismantled. She has been banned from speaking to the press, and all researchers in U.S. federal agencies are forbidden from communicating with their foreign colleagues. The level of intimidation is staggering.  

**05:41 (Speaker D)**  
There is no precedent for this in a modern democratic country. It resembles the tactics of totalitarian regimes.

#### **Censorship and McCarthyism**
**06:29 (Speaker E)**  
Yes, it’s completely unexpected. I never thought I’d see this in my lifetime. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest biomedical research institute in the world, has already cut 6% of its staff.  

**08:52 (Speaker C)**  
There is no justification. We are in an Orwellian moment. It’s as if, when Trump decides it, *two plus two equals five*. Scientific truths are erased as if they never existed.

#### **Viewer Call-In: Former French Minister Agnès Buzyn**
**15:21 (Speaker B)**  
Let’s turn to the France Inter listener line, where we have a former Minister of Health. Agnès Buzyn, good morning!  

**15:28 (Speaker F - Agnès Buzyn, Former Health Minister)**  
Good morning, Mr. Demorand.  

**15:31 (Speaker B)**  
You wanted to join the discussion on the attacks on science in the United States?  

**15:42 (Speaker F)**  
Absolutely. First of all, I want to thank you for holding this debate, and I commend the scientists who are fighting relentlessly against the obscurantism spreading in the U.S. today.  

But something strikes me—only scientists are speaking out. Science is a democratic issue; it should concern all of us.  

**16:04 (Speaker F)**  
We need collective action to bring science back to the center of democratic debate. That’s why I’ve been working for the past year on a forum to engage civil society in the role of science in democracy. I’m launching a think tank called *"Evidence"*, and I’ll hold a press conference on March 11 to discuss these issues.  

**17:06 (Speaker B)**  
Scientists alone shouldn’t have to defend science.  

**17:08 (Speaker F)**  
Exactly. It goes far beyond that.

#### **Conclusion**
**24:02 (Speaker A)**  
A very bleak picture, thank you. And tomorrow is Friday.  

**24:07 (Speaker C)**  
Yes, we must fight. The situation is dire, but we must fight. I encourage everyone who cares about science to join us this Friday.  

**24:12 (Speaker A)**  
It’s a global day of mobilization for science, for researchers, for universities, for everything that defines our civilization.  

**24:20 (Speaker D)**  
And to show support for American scientists who are facing unprecedented attacks.  

**24:26 (Speaker A)**  
Where will the gathering be in Paris?  

**24:28 (Speaker C)**  
It will start at 1:30 PM at Jussieu.
