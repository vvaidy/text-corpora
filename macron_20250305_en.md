### **French Citizens, My Dear Compatriots,**
I am addressing you this evening due to the international situation and its consequences for our country and for Europe, following several weeks of diplomatic action. 

I know that you are legitimately concerned about the historic events unfolding before us, events that are disrupting the world order. The war in Ukraine, which has led to nearly a million deaths and injuries, continues with the same intensity. The United States of America, our ally, has changed its position on this war, reducing its support for Ukraine and casting uncertainty over what comes next.  

At the same time, these same United States of America seek to impose tariffs on European products. The world is becoming increasingly brutal, and the terrorist threat remains strong. In sum, our prosperity and our security have become more uncertain.

We must acknowledge that we are entering a new era. The war in Ukraine has now lasted more than three years. From the very first day, we chose to support Ukraine and to sanction Russia. 

And we were right to do so. Because it is not only the Ukrainian people who are courageously fighting for their freedom—it is also our own security that is at stake. If a country can invade its neighbor in Europe with impunity, then no one can feel truly safe.

This would be a return to the law of the strongest. And peace could no longer be guaranteed on our continent. History has taught us this.

Beyond Ukraine, the Russian threat is here. It affects European nations, and it affects us. Russia has already turned the Ukrainian conflict into a global one.

It has brought North Korean soldiers to our continent, deployed Iranian equipment, and simultaneously helped these countries strengthen their military capacities. President Putin’s Russia violates our borders to assassinate opponents, manipulates elections in Romania and Moldova, and carries out cyberattacks on our hospitals, disrupting their operations.

Russia attempts to manipulate our public opinions with falsehoods spread across social media. And at its core, it is testing our limits—whether in the air, at sea, in space, or behind our screens.

This aggression knows no bounds. And at the same time, Russia continues to rearm itself, devoting more than 40% of its budget to military expansion. By 2030, it plans to further increase its forces—300,000 additional soldiers, 3,000 more tanks, 300 additional fighter jets.

So, who can believe that today's Russia will stop at Ukraine? At this moment and for the years to come, Russia has become a threat to France and to Europe. I deeply regret this. And I remain convinced that, in the long term, peace will return to our continent only when Russia regains a sense of calm and peacefulness.

But the reality I describe to you today is what we must face. And in the face of such a dangerous world, standing idle would be madness. We must act swiftly for Ukraine, for the security of the French people, for the security of Europeans.

### **For Ukraine, First and Foremost**
All initiatives that contribute to peace are welcome, and I commend them tonight. We must continue to help the Ukrainians resist until they can negotiate a solid peace—one that ensures their security and ours.

This is why the path to peace cannot involve abandoning Ukraine—on the contrary. Peace cannot be achieved at any price, nor under Russian dictation. Peace cannot mean the capitulation of Ukraine.

It cannot mean Ukraine’s collapse. Nor can it be a ceasefire that would be too fragile. Why? Because we have the lessons of the past.

We cannot forget that Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, and we then negotiated a ceasefire in Minsk. That same Russia did not respect that ceasefire. And we failed to maintain the balance of power due to a lack of solid guarantees.

Today, we can no longer take Russia at its word. Ukraine has the right to peace and security, and that is in our interest—indeed, in the interest of the entire European continent’s security. This is the path we are pursuing with our British, German, and other European allies.

This is why, in recent weeks, you have seen me gathering several European leaders in Paris, and visiting London just a few days ago to strengthen the commitments necessary for Ukraine. Once peace is signed, to prevent Ukraine from being invaded again by Russia, we must be prepared.

This will certainly require long-term support for the Ukrainian army. It may also require the deployment of European forces—not to engage in combat today, not to fight on the frontlines—but rather, once peace is achieved, to ensure that it is fully respected. Next week, we will gather in Paris with the chiefs of staff of countries willing to take responsibility in this regard.

Thus, we have developed, alongside Ukraine and several European partners, a plan for a solid, lasting, and verifiable peace. I have defended this plan in the United States and across Europe. And I hope that the United States will remain by our side. But we must be prepared if that is not the case.

Whether peace in Ukraine is secured soon or not, European nations must—given the Russian threat I have described—become capable of better defending themselves and deterring further aggression. Yes, whatever happens, we must invest more in our own security, strengthen our defense posture—not for the sake of war, but for the sake of deterrence.

### **Reinforcing European Independence**
We remain committed to NATO and our partnership with the United States. But we must do more. We must reinforce our independence in defense and security. The future of Europe should not be decided in Washington or Moscow.

Yes, the threat is rising again in the East. The innocence of the past 30 years—since the fall of the Berlin Wall—is over. Tomorrow in Brussels, at the extraordinary Council bringing together the 27 EU leaders, we will take decisive steps.

Several measures that France has long advocated will finally be adopted. EU member states will be able to increase their military spending without it affecting their deficits. Massive common investments will be directed toward producing munitions, tanks, and cutting-edge weapons on European soil.

I have asked the government to ensure that this strengthens our armed forces as quickly as possible and contributes to reindustrializing our regions. The European defense vision we have been advocating for eight years is becoming a reality.

### **France’s Unique Role**
In this new era, France has a special status. We have the most capable military in Europe. And thanks to the decisions made by our predecessors after World War II, we possess nuclear deterrence capabilities.

These capabilities protect us far more than many of our neighbors. We did not wait for the invasion of Ukraine to recognize that the world is growing more dangerous. Through the military programming laws I initiated, we have nearly doubled our defense budget in a decade.

But given the accelerating threats, we must make new budgetary decisions and essential investments. I have tasked the government with working on this swiftly. These investments will require private and public financing—but taxes will not be raised.

### **A Call to Action**
To achieve this, reforms, choices, and courage will be necessary. Our nuclear deterrence safeguards us. It is complete, sovereign, and fully French.

It has, since 1964, played a crucial role in preserving peace and security in Europe. And responding to Germany’s call, I have decided to open a strategic debate on how our nuclear deterrence might also help protect our European allies.

Mastering our destiny, achieving greater independence—we must pursue this not only militarily but also economically. Independence in technology, industry, and finance is essential.

We must also prepare for potential U.S. tariffs on European goods, as they have already imposed on Canada and Mexico. This unjustifiable decision will have economic repercussions, but we will not remain passive.

### **The Spirit of a Nation**
Political decisions, military equipment, and budgets are essential, but they will never replace the spirit of a nation. Our generation will no longer enjoy the dividends of peace. But it is up to us to ensure that our children reap the dividends of our commitments.

Together, we will stand. 

**Long live the Republic, long live France.**
